                <p>Hey all, welcome to Slime Adventures! This website features the one and only thing you came here for: slimes! Here's the thing, you get to find out which type of slime you are. So, how does it work? There will be two or more choices to pick from, organized in a sort of tree system. During this process, cards with attached lore will be shown to you. Whichever one you choose, you'll get a slime based on that choice. There will be multiple endings that determine which slime you are. And if you'd like, you can show all your friends the slime you obtained. All of the slimes will be downloadable. With that covered, I hope you all enjoy yourselves!</p>
